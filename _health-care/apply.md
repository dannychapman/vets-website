The VA operates America’s largest integrated health care system, with over 700 sites of care. It is consistently ranked among the nation’s top health care providers.

Health care at the VA includes preventive, primary, and specialty care; prescriptions; mental health care; home health care; geriatrics and extended care; medical equipment and prosthetics; and more. Most Veterans qualify for cost-free health care services, although some Veterans must pay modest copays for health care or prescriptions.

### Am I eligible?
If you served on active duty, and separated under conditions other than dishonorable, you may qualify for VA health care.

> TIP: If you separated under a dishonorable discharge, check out [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/).

If one (or more) of the following applies to you, you most likely qualify for VA health care:

- You receive financial compensation from the VA for a service-connected disability
- You were discharged for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty
- You are a recently discharged Combat Veteran
- You receive a VA pension
- You are a former Prisoner of War
- You have received a Purple Heart
- You receive (or are eligible for) Medicaid benefits
- You served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962 and May 7, 1975
- You served in SW Asia during the Gulf War between August 2, 1990 and November 11, 1998
- You served at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune between August 1, 1953 and December 31, 1987

If none of the above apply to you, you may still qualify for care based on your income. [Learn more about income thresholds here](#)

> TIP: Your most recent tax return will have most of information you need to qualify based on your income.
