If none of the above apply to you, you may still qualify for care based on your income.Â Learn more about how the amount of money your family makes ([income threshold](http://nationalincomelimits.vaftl.us/)) can affect your eligibility for VA benefits.

**Notes:** 

- If you separated under a dishonorable discharge to see if you qualify for health insurance, visit [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/).
- Your most recent tax return will have most of information you need to qualify based on your income.
